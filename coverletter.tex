My coauthors and I are pleased to submit an original research article entitled ``Space Matters: extending sensitivity analysis to initial spatial conditions in geosimulation models'' for consideration for publication in Computer, Environment and Urban Systems.

This article deals with the central yet poorly explored issue of the sensitivity of geosimulation models to their spatial context (i.e. the spatial configuration of agents and their environment), and more precisely their spatial initial conditions. We think the subject in general and the novelty of the paper in particular will meet the interest of the readers of CEUS, a journal dealing with computerised models and urban systems.

Despite some preliminary results being presented as at ECTQG 2015, Bari, and at Geocomputation Conference 2017, Leeds, we confirm that neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration or published in another journal. We did not have any previous interaction with CEUS regarding this manuscript. We have no conflicts of interest to disclose. We do not have any opposed reviewer.
